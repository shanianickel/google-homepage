This is a CSS/HTML exercise cloning the layout, but not the functionality, of the Google homepage.

This exercise is from The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css)

Things I have learned:
	-Laying out webpages as a novice is even less intuituve than I first realized.
	-Even the Google homepage appears slightly different to when loading in Firefox vs. Chrome
	-Sometimes text colour/styles can be surprisingly inconvenient to manipulate when dealing with links. At least for a novice. :)
	-Google itself is a godsend. I found a very nice resource that breaks down how to layout webpages with CSS that I found to be very helpful and can see myself coming back to again and again - [Learn Layout](http://learnlayout.com/)
